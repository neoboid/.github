# About
Neoboid is a one man software contractor company, founded late 2019 by me; Andreas Andersson ([@derwiath](https://github.com/derwiath)).
Andreas expertice is programming games, and that's where he and thus Neoboid spends most of their time.

This github organization will hold trinkets and gems Neoboid wants to share with the world. Enjoy.
